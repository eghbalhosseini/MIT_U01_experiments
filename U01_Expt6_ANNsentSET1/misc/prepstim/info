participants press a button to hear each next sentence, but the script should also auto-advance to the next stimulus if no button press happened for, say, 3s. The screen can just have a fixation cross between the sentences and maybe a plain white/grey screen when the sentence is playing. We may intersperse a few nonword sequences into the sentence stream, and the order of trials will be fixed for this expt. All the usual stuff should be the same: we should be able to quit out of it at any time, etc.
